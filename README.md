# Welcome to the Daily AI Pulse!

This channel delivers a daily snapshot of the latest breakthroughs, product launches, and strategic moves from top AI companies like OpenAI, Anthropic, xAI, and DeepMind.

Powered by a custom-built AI agent, the summaries are automatically generated by scraping company posts on X (Twitter) and using GPT-4 to distill the most important insights — all before you start your day.

This is just a glimpse of how we can use AI to automate research and stay ahead of fast-moving trends. Imagine the possibilities as we extend this approach across other domains!

## Setting Up OpenAI API

To use GPT-4 for summarizing posts, you need to obtain an OpenAI API key.

### 1. Create an OpenAI Account
- Go to [https://platform.openai.com/signup](https://platform.openai.com/signup) and create an account, or sign in if you already have one.

### 2. Generate an API Key
- Visit the [API keys page](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys).
- Click on **"Create new secret key"**.
- Copy the generated key. This is your `OPENAI_API_KEY`.

### 3. Add the Key to GitHub Secrets
- Go to your GitHub repository
- Navigate to **Settings** → **Secrets and variables** → **Actions**
- Click **New repository secret**
- Set:
  - **Name**: `OPENAI_API_KEY`
  - **Value**: *your OpenAI API key*

**Note:** Keep your API key private. Do not share it or commit it in your code.

## Setting up Twitter API Access

To use the updated script with Twitter's official API, you'll need to set up the following secrets in your GitHub repository:

### Step 1: Create a Twitter Developer Account
1. Go to [Twitter Developer Portal](https://developer.twitter.com/)
2. Sign up for a developer account if you don't have one
3. Create a project and app within the developer portal

### Step 2: Generate API Keys and Tokens
From your Twitter Developer Dashboard:
1. Navigate to your project/app settings
2. Generate Consumer Keys (API Key and API Secret)
3. Generate Access Token and Access Token Secret
4. Get your Bearer Token

### Step 3: Add Secrets to GitHub Repository
1. Go to your GitHub repository
2. Navigate to Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions
3. Add the following secrets:

| Secret Name             | Description                  |
|-------------------------|------------------------------|
| `TWITTER_API_KEY`       | Your Twitter API Key         |
| `TWITTER_API_SECRET`    | Your Twitter API Secret      |
| `TWITTER_ACCESS_TOKEN`  | Your Twitter Access Token    |
| `TWITTER_ACCESS_SECRET` | Your Twitter Access Secret   |

### Step 4: Ensure API Permissions
In your Twitter Developer Portal app settings, make sure you have:

2. Elevated API access (if you need higher rate limits)

### Note on Rate Limits
The standard Twitter API has rate limits. If you're monitoring multiple accounts, you might want to consider applying for elevated access.
