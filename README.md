# Welcome to the Daily AI Pulse!

This channel delivers a daily snapshot of the latest breakthroughs, product launches, and strategic moves from top AI companies like OpenAI, Anthropic, xAI, and DeepMind.

Powered by a custom-built AI agent, the summaries are automatically generated by scraping company posts on X (Twitter) and using GPT-4 to distill the most important insights — all before you start your day.

This is just a glimpse of how we can use AI to automate research and stay ahead of fast-moving trends. Imagine the possibilities as we extend this approach across other domains!

## Setting Up OpenAI API

To use GPT-4 for summarizing posts, you need to obtain an OpenAI API key.

### 1. Create an OpenAI Account
- Go to [https://platform.openai.com/signup](https://platform.openai.com/signup) and create an account, or sign in if you already have one.

### 2. Generate an API Key
- Visit the [API keys page](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys).
- Click on **"Create new secret key"**.
- Copy the generated key. This is your `OPENAI_API_KEY`.

### 3. Add the Key to GitHub Secrets
- Go to your GitHub repository
- Navigate to **Settings** → **Secrets and variables** → **Actions**
- Click **New repository secret**
- Set:
  - **Name**: `OPENAI_API_KEY`

**Note:** Keep your API key private. Do not share it or commit it in your code.
